// RAGNAROKMAC (companions start unequipped): a companion the engine never dresses.
//
// The engine dresses a drafted companion from its job's gear set, and again at a job change
// and wherever a slot is found empty. Settings -> Population -> Companions start unequipped
// (population_engine_companion_start_unequipped, off by default) drafts a companion with
// nothing on instead, and from then on the engine gives that companion no gear at all: what it
// wears is what its owner gave it. The companion remembers how it was drafted
// (cp_companion_persistence.start_unequipped), so the setting changes no existing companion.
//
// It is also what lets a plan switch gear later: with nothing of the engine's on it, every
// piece a companion wears or carries is its owner's, and none has to be told apart.
//
// Ammunition and potions are not gear here; they keep their own settings.

// a carried one on, "take" hands a carried one back to the owner. The Companions window's Gear

// engine's own gear poll does.
